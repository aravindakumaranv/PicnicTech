AOP PICNIC TECHNOLOGIES 

This project contains the final submission for the Analytics Project 

The following libraries have been used:
1. pandas 
2. matplotlib
3. gurobipy

We have 5 files namely:

1. Exact.ipynb - which has the implementation of the mathematical model using gurobi 
2. Approach1.ipynb - which has the ASMH(Adapted silver meal heuristic) with inventory as the construction heuristic and Aggregating Orders as the improvement heursitic. 
3. Approach2.ipynb - which has the ASMH(Adapted silver meal heuristic) with inventory as the construction heuristic and Aggregating Orders as the improvement heursitic 1 and Carry Forward Orders as improvement heuristic 2. 
4. Approach3.ipynb - which has the ASMH(Adapted silver meal heuristic  as the construction heuristic and Aggregating Orders as the improvement heursitic 1 and Carry Forward Orders as improvement heuristic 2. 
5. data_analysis.ipynb - contains all the graphs obatained by data analysis. 


In order to run these scripts make sure to have:
    1. All the libraries mentioned above and 3.11+ version of python installed
    2. The datasets loaded in the folder called data
    3. To run a specific instance - make sure to enter the product type (ambient, chilled, frozen), time period (7, 365), storage type (standard, relaxed, constrained), maximum order penalty (0, 1000)
